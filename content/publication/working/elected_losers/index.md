abstract: "Does party performance in elections shape elected politicians' satisfaction with democracy? While losing candidates are known to become less satisfied with democracy, little is understood about how winning politicians react when their party underperforms. This article argues that elected officials grow frustrated with democracy when their party loses influence over the executive or legislative branch. Using longitudinal data from 8,141 Latin American legislators, we show that both opposition status and seat losses reduce democratic satisfaction and trust in elections. These effects are robust across specifications and remain significant even in consolidated democracies. Running the models among individuals identified using observables ($N=$ 1,535) render similar results. Interviews with opposition legislators suggest that dissatisfaction is often channeled through frustrations with internal party dynamics. Our findings have critical implications for democratic stability, as discontented legislators hold formal decision-making power. Moreover, these elected losers may amplify broader dissatisfaction due to their visibility as winning candidates."

#summary: Why do voters reward governments for targeted benefits? The obvious explanation is pocketbook motivations, i.e. the tendency to hold incumbents accountable for personal welfare changes. But in most cases, this behavior is equally consistent with a group-based response, i.e. voters rewarding the government for targeting their in-group. I test and find support for this alternative explanation in three survey experiments in Denmark and the US, suggesting that the effect is highly heterogeneous depending on group identity strength.
