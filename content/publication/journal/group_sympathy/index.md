abstract: "Recent scholarship devotes considerable attention to how social identities influence vote choice. However, group sympathies or group affect constitutes another, often overlooked subjective component of the relationship between social groups and vote choice. Based on reference group theory and drawing on ANES data as well as recent Danish and Austrian election surveys, we examine how votersâ€™ sympathies with a range of groups are related to party choice across time and space. We find that group sympathies are related to vote choice in all three countries even when controlling for objective group memberships and social identities. Across time, most relationships are stable or strengthening and comparable in strength to the relationship between group memberships and party choice. The relationship between group sympathies and vote choice is, furthermore, conditioned by perceived linkages between groups and parties. Hence, analyses of the role of social groups in voting need to also include group sympathies to grasp the full influence of social groups."
#summary: Party reputations are an essential feature of party competition. Earlier scholarship identifies parties' connections to social groups as an important constituent component of party reputations, and tends to see party reputations as stable in the short run. We challenge this view, arguing that group appeals, i.e. valenced references to social groups, can in fact lead to short-run changes in party-group linkages. Using an automated approach, we measure group appeals in party speech in Britain over 3 decades and link it to survey data. We find that citizens keep 'running tallies' of group appeals and frequently update perceptions of their group linkages in response to group appeals by party elites.
