abstract: "In this chapter, we examine voters' sympathies with seven key groups - the young and the elderly; the working class and the upper middle class; urban and non-urban dwellers; and Muslims - and how these sympathies are related to party choice. The groups experience varying levels of sympathy among voters, and voters' perceptions of which parties represent each group change somewhat over time. Furthermore, we find that voters' attitudes towards the groups affect their party choice, such that parties associated with a given group receive more votes among those who sympathise with the group. This points to group sympathies as an overlooked explanation in electoral research, which has long focused on objective group memberships. Despite the diminished importance of group memberships, our analyses show that social groups still play an important role in Danish voter behaviour."
#summary: In this chapter, we examine voters' sympathies with seven key groups - the young and the elderly; the working class and the upper middle class; urban and non-urban dwellers; and Muslims - and how these sympathies are related to party choice. We find that voters' attitudes towards the groups affect their party choice, such that parties associated with a given group receive more votes among those who sympathise with the group. This points to group sympathies as a neglected explanation in electoral research, which has long focused on objective group memberships. Despite the diminished importance of group memberships, our analyses show that social groups still play an important role in Danish voter behaviour.
