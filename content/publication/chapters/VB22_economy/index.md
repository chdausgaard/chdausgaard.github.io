abstract: Danish voters had very negative perceptions of the economy in 2022, but this had a limited impact on government support. In fact, we find that those who were hit hardest by inflation were more likely to vote for the incumbent Social Democrats. This can partly be explained by the fact that support for left-wing parties increases as the population becomes poorer and demands more redistribution. But the government’s aid packages also appear to have made a difference. Voters who received the so-called ‘Heating check’, a targeted cash transfer, showed higher support for the government. Overall, our analysis suggests that the economic crisis was not a major disadvantage for the incumbent government and that, to some extent, it gave the government an opportunity to attract and retain economically vulnerable voters.
