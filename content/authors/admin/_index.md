I'm a political scientist studying political behavior, drawing on a combination of experiments, text-as-data methods, and causal inference designs for observational data. I'm currently a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Copenhagen, where I will continue as a postdoc in Fall 2025. 

I'm interested in how voters are shaped by economic interests and group identities, as well as how they respond to elite behavior. In my dissertation, I examine the role of group identities in retrospective voting. How do voters evaluate government performance when policies affect people differently? How do voters’ group identities guide their interpretations of policy and incumbent performance? My first paper, conditionally accepted in the *American Journal of Political Science*, draws on cross-country experiments to argue that voters engage in group-based retrospective voting, holding incumbents accountable for the economic performance of their social groups. In my second paper, conditionally accepted in the *Journal of Politics*, I and my co-author, Frederik Hjorth, examine how voters' perceptions of group-party linkages are shaped by rhetorical group appeals using a language model to classify party elite communication over three decades. In a third paper, I investigate how reliably voters punish and reward incumbents for policy-induced disposable income changes by applying policy microsimulation models to a large survey panel. 

Beyond my dissertation research, I work on related topics in political behavior. In one paper, co-authored with Frederik Hjorth and Martin Vinæs Larsen, we study the effects of mainstream party accommodation of the radical right. In another, co-authored with Daniel Cruz, we study how Latin American legislators' support for democracy is shaped by their own party's access to power. Finally, in a paper co-authored with Greg Eady, we study how damaging information about politicians can increase partisans' general cynicism towards politics rather than fostering accountability.
