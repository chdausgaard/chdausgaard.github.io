I’m a political scientist studying political behavior. I received my PhD in Political Science from the University of Copenhagen in Fall 2025, where I am now a postdoctoral researcher. My work has been published in the *American Journal of Political Science* and *Journal of Politics*.

My research focuses on how voters’ economic interests and group identities shape their political judgments. My dissertation examines how group identities structure retrospective voting — how voters evaluate incumbents based on outcomes for their social groups, how parties’ rhetorical appeals shape perceived group-party linkages, and how voters respond to policy-induced changes in their personal finances.

Beyond the dissertation, I work on related projects in political behavior, e.g., how mainstream party accommodation of the radical right affects voters, how legislators’ support for democracy depends on their party’s access to power, and whether governments’ rhetorical appeals to social groups reflect actual policy outcomes.
